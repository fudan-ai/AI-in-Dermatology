The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly influenced modern healthcare, particularly in dermatology for skin cancer detection. In 2024, with 208,910 new cases of skin cancer, including melanoma, reported in the United States <sup>[1](#r1)</sup> , the importance of early detection for better patient outcomes has become even more evident. AI models have revolutionized skin cancer diagnosis by greatly improving the accuracy and efficiency of early malignancy detection. However, there are still challenges in the practical application of these AI models, especially concerning data diversity, model interpretability, and clinical integration. This work is dedicated to compiling a comprehensive dataset that captures these developments. We extend our gratitude to the community for maintaining such a valuable dataset resource. Thank you.
